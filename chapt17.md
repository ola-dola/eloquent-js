# Drawing on Canvas

Some tasks, such as drawing a line between arbitrary points, are extremely awkward to do with regular HTML elements. we’d be using the DOM for something that it wasn’t originally designed for.

> "There are two alternatives. The first is DOM-based but utilizes Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), rather than HTML. Think of SVG as a document-markup dialect that focuses on shapes rather than text. You can embed an SVG document directly in an HTML document or include it with an <img> tag. The second alternative is a `canvas`".
