# Asynchronous Programming

> It is useful to think of promises as a device to move values into an asynchronous reality. __A normal value is simply there. A promised value is a value that might already be there or might appear at some point in the future.__

Programming asynchronously is made easier by promises, objects that represent actions that might complete in the future, and async functions, which allow you to write an asynchronous program as if it were synchronous.
